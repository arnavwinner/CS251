## Follow the instructions below for the running of code.

1. Find the directory where the following files are present: asg2.l, asg2.y, correct.txt, incorrect.txt, a.out.
2. correct.txt contains valid PASCAL code & incorrect.txt contains invalid PASCAL code. We would test them using the bison generated parser.
3. Run the files using: "./a.out <file name>".

## NOTE
1. Just ignore the warnings while compilation.
2. Write the pascal code in lowercase letters (since Pascal is case insensitive language).


## Commands to follow:

The following commands can be executed in the terminal which are used to generate the parser on the given input files.

1. `flex assignment2.l`: Using Flex tool to generate lexical analyser
2. `bison -d assignment2.y`: Using Bison to generate parser
3. `gcc assignment2.tab.c -ll`: Compile C code generated by Bison
4. `./a.out <File Name>`: <File Name> is the input file name which would be parsed by the executable file generated by gcc command above.
