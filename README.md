# CS251: Introduction to Language Processing

## Building a Pascal Lexical Analyzer

**Objective**: Develop a lexical analyzer (token generator) for the "Pascal" programming language.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to execute the Pascal Lexical Analyzer (Pascal.l file):

1. Generate the lexer code: `lex Pascal.l`

2. Compile the lexer code: `gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer -ll`

3. Run the lexer: `./lexer`

Now, you can analyze Pascal syntax by running the `./lexer` executable and providing input through the terminal by running the syntax line by line and getting the desired output.
